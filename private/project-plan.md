# 1.0 Introduction

This project aims to create a desktop application to give Clash Royale suggestions to the user. The design team, Kashyap Sukshavasi, Johnathan Han, and Albert Lungu has a horizontal management structure meaning there is no specific project manager. The client is Steven Quast and the target audience for the project is mainly for anyone who likes to play Clash Royale as they would want to improve their skills. 

# 1.1 Project Description

This application will provide Clash Royale players with a recommendation with what cards to play and where to place them. The application will be separate from the main Clash Royale client (played on desktop) and will show where to play a card and what card to play in real time. The application does not interact with the game client, automate gameplay, or be used in live matches. The tool is intended for research and analysis, not for general public use. 

# 2.0 Client Requirements 

For this project, The design team has chosen to work with Steven Quast, a physics teacher at Merivale High School, in order for him to utilize the application for his friendly Clash Royale games

# 4.0 Resources

*Note: Remember to always include a transition paragraph between sections. So if all of your info is in 4.1 and 4.2, you should make sure there are a couple of sentences in 4.0 that provide an introduction to the purpose of the section and what the subsections will contain.* 

## 4.1 Team Structure

Outline your team structure, if applicable.

## 4.2 Software 

List your software design platform here in full (Language(s), servers, IDE's, API's, etc...). You should also include which platform you will be using to manage your project/sprint backlogs (google sheets, github, etc.).

# 5.0 Risk Analysis

This is a very important component. Outline at least 3 potential risks. Give this some thought so that the risks are realistic and represent the highest risks in terms of likelihood of occurrence (likely to happen) or impact (something that would significantly impact the success of the project).  

For each risk describe preventative measures, corrective actions, and the risk level (the coloured cells in the matrix below).

| Risk Matrix | Severity |  |  |  |
| ----- | ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  **Probability** |  | **Major** | **Moderate** | **Minor** |
|  | **High** | High | High | Medium |
|  | **Medium** | High | Medium | Low |
|  | **Low** | Medium | Low | Low |

# 6.0 Team Policies

**For Teams**  
In order to keep amicable relations within the team, some team policies must be set.

# 6.1 Time Commitment

All members will work in class and if given the time or if more time is needed, work will be done outside of class. 

# 6.2 Accountability and Communication

The members are expected to be active on Discord to make sure updates reach all members. Members are also responsible for making sure updates reach either other (whether online or in-person) 

6.3 Friendship \\(-◡-)/  
The team will keep a light atmosphere while working, listening to K-pop playlists and cracking jokes.
